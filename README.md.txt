🧮 HR Analytics Dashboard
📊 Project Overview

This project is an HR Analytics Dashboard developed using Python and Power BI, based on the IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition Dataset.
It helps visualize and analyze employee attrition, demographics, and satisfaction trends to derive data-driven HR insights.

🧰 Tools & Technologies

Python – Data cleaning, preprocessing, and EDA (Pandas, NumPy)

Power BI – Dashboard design and interactive visualizations

DAX – KPI creation and business metrics

Dataset: IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition Dataset (Kaggle)

🧩 Process Workflow

1️⃣ Data Cleaning (Python):

Handled missing values and categorical encoding using Pandas.

Removed redundant fields and structured data for visualization.

2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (Python):

Performed statistical analysis and generated trend insights.

Verified data consistency before visualization.

3️⃣ Dashboard Development (Power BI):

Created interactive dashboards with slicers, KPIs, and DAX measures.

Designed 2 main dashboard pages:

Overview: Key metrics like Attrition Rate, Avg Salary, Experience

Demographics & Satisfaction: Workforce distribution, job satisfaction, and work-life balance

The Sales Department shows the highest attrition rate.

Employees aged 25–35 have the highest turnover.

Work-life balance and satisfaction strongly influence attrition.

🎓 Learning Outcome

This project strengthened my understanding of the end-to-end data analytics pipeline, from data cleaning and EDA in Python to building dashboards and KPIs in Power BI.
